# Activity-Recognition-Model
AI/ML build a model capable of detecting various activities of workers in a warehouse environment and other in door objects. The goal is to monitor and classify activities of workers such as sitting, walking, working, and also the objects by which they interact. The purpose is to identify what happened in case of accidents or so to provide better protection and working environment. Key Responsibilities: Develop and implement a machine learning model for activity recognition. Analyze video footage or sensor data to classify worker activities. Provide insights on the best technologies to use (e.g., deep learning, computer vision,). Ensure the model can work in real-time or near real-time conditions. Collaborate on integrating the model with warehouse monitoring systems. Requirements: Strong background in AI/ML, computer vision, and activity recognition. Experience with tools such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV, etc. Knowledge of data processing, annotation, and model training. Familiarity with video analytics or sensor-based activity detection. Previous experience working on similar projects is a plus.
--------------------
To build a machine learning model for detecting various activities of workers in a warehouse environment, we can leverage computer vision techniques along with deep learning. Below is a structured approach that includes sample Python code snippets using libraries such as TensorFlow, OpenCV, and others. This model will focus on monitoring activities like sitting, walking, and working, and can also identify objects workers interact with.
Step-by-Step Guide to Build the Activity Recognition Model

    Data Collection and Annotation: Gather video footage or sensor data from the warehouse. Use tools like Labelbox or CVAT to annotate activities and objects.

    Data Preprocessing: Process the video frames to create a dataset suitable for training a deep learning model.

    Model Selection: Use a convolutional neural network (CNN) for spatial feature extraction, potentially combined with a recurrent neural network (RNN) or 3D CNN for temporal sequence modeling.

    Training the Model: Train the model on annotated data.

    Real-time Detection: Implement the model to perform real-time or near-real-time activity recognition.

    Integration: Integrate the model with warehouse monitoring systems.

Sample Python Code Snippets
1. Data Preprocessing

python

import cv2
import numpy as np
import os

def extract_frames(video_path, output_dir, frame_rate=1):
    os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)
    video_capture = cv2.VideoCapture(video_path)
    count = 0

    while video_capture.isOpened():
        ret, frame = video_capture.read()
        if not ret:
            break

        if count % frame_rate == 0:
            frame_filename = os.path.join(output_dir, f'frame_{count}.jpg')
            cv2.imwrite(frame_filename, frame)

        count += 1

    video_capture.release()
    print(f"Extracted {count} frames to {output_dir}")

# Example usage
extract_frames('warehouse_video.mp4', 'extracted_frames', frame_rate=30)

2. Model Development

Using TensorFlow and Keras for activity recognition.

python

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

def create_model(input_shape, num_classes):
    model = models.Sequential()
    model.add(layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=input_shape))
    model.add(layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))
    model.add(layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'))
    model.add(layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)))
    model.add(layers.Flatten())
    model.add(layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'))
    model.add(layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax'))

    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model

# Example usage
input_shape = (64, 64, 3)  # Adjust based on your frame size
num_classes = 4  # Number of activities
model = create_model(input_shape, num_classes)

3. Training the Model

python

from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator

# Load and preprocess data
train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1.0/255.0)
train_generator = train_datagen.flow_from_directory(
    'data/train',  # Path to training data
    target_size=(64, 64),
    batch_size=32,
    class_mode='categorical'
)

# Train the model
model.fit(train_generator, epochs=10, steps_per_epoch=len(train_generator))

4. Real-time Detection

python

def detect_activity(video_source):
    video_capture = cv2.VideoCapture(video_source)

    while True:
        ret, frame = video_capture.read()
        if not ret:
            break

        # Preprocess frame
        frame_resized = cv2.resize(frame, (64, 64)) / 255.0
        frame_array = np.expand_dims(frame_resized, axis=0)

        # Predict activity
        predictions = model.predict(frame_array)
        activity = np.argmax(predictions)

        # Display results
        cv2.putText(frame, f'Activity: {activity}', (10, 30), cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 1, (0, 255, 0), 2)
        cv2.imshow('Video', frame)

        if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
            break

    video_capture.release()
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()

# Example usage
detect_activity(0)  # Use '0' for webcam or a video file path
